# This extension is unmaintained

At first, after having seen the extension abandoned by its original author
and since I was still using it, I decided to try to maintain a fork. But
I quickly discovered a better maintained alternative and I suggest that
you switch to it:

* https://github.com/blackjackshellac/kitchenTimer
* https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3955/kitchen-timer/

The gnome-shell-timer repository that you are looking at has some
supplementary work compared to
[olebowle](https://github.com/olebowle/gnome-shell-timer)'s repo and is
known to work with GNOME 3.38. But don't expect further changes to it.

# Maintenance status

Since Ole Ernst (the original author) lost interest in gnome-shell-timer
and since pull requests were left unanswered, and since I was regularly
working on it as part of my Debian packaging work, I decided to step up to
maintain this extension.

I don't plan to add new features but I will at least process pull requests
to keep the extension working with the latest GNOME versions and I will
happily grant commit rights to other contributors that have shown some
ability and desire to maintain the extension.
